#Best Shuffle

Shuffle the characters of a string in such a way that as many of the character values are in a different position as possible.

Print the result as follows: original string, shuffled string, (score). The score gives the number of positions whose character value did not change.

For example: tree, eetr, (0)

A shuffle that produces a randomized result among the best choices is to be preferred. A deterministic approach that produces the same sequence every time is acceptable as an alternative.

The words to test with are: abracadabra, seesaw, elk, grrrrrr, up,
